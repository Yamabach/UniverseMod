		 Restart the game to load the entity once this file is completed.
		 
		 Values that should always be changed are marked with "TODO".
		 
		 See the documentation for further information on any of these elements.

	<!-- ID of your entity. This ID must be unique among the entities that your mod adds.
		 (It can conflict with other mods, the mod loader will handle this.)
		 The easiest way of handling IDs is to just give your entities the IDs 1, 2, 3, etc. -->

	<!-- Normally, when a level with a modded entity is loaded, but that entity is not loaded, the entity will be ignored.
		 If the entity has a fallback specified here, the fallback entity is loaded instead in this scenario.
	 
		 Valid values are numeric entity IDs or the name of an entity, as returned by the .Name property of the Entity class.
		 Only normal entities can be specified as fallbacks, not modded entities. -->
